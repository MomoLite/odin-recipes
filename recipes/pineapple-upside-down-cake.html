        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Pineapple upside-down cake is a gorgeous retro dessert that delights all ages! This easy recipe uses a cast iron skillet to bake the tender sweet cake and perfectly caramelized pineapple and cherries.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (20 ounce) can pineapple rings</li>
            <li>one-fourth cup of water, or as needed</li>
            <li>half a cup of unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix (such as Betty Crocker Super Moist)</li>
            <li>half a cup of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 large egg whites</li>
            <li>one and a half cups of brown sugar</li>
            <li>7 maraschino cherries</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Drain canned pineapple into a 1-cup measure. Add water if needed to measure 1 cup. Set aside juice and 7 pineapple rings for the cake. Set any remaining juice and rings aside for another use.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a 10- or 11-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>While butter is melting, combine cake mix, reserved 1 cup pineapple juice, vegetable oil, and egg whites in a mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove melted butter from the heat and sprinkle brown sugar evenly over top until all butter is covered. Arrange 6 pineapple rings around the outer edge of the skillet and the remaining ring in the center without overlapping. Place a maraschino cherry into the center of each pineapple ring. Pour cake batter over the pineapples.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, 25 to 28 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let cool in the skillet for 10 minutes; don't let the cake cool too much or it will stick to the pan.</li>
            <li>Run an offset spatula around the edges to gently loosen cake. Place a plate over the skillet, then flip and carefully turn the warm cake out onto a plate. Transfer any fruit or glaze that sticks in the skillet back to the cake.</li>
        </ol>
